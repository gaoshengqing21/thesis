# Tokenizer :file_folder:
The Tokenizer sub-project is meant to
* Process the original Java projects  
* Extract tokens from Java methods located inside given files
* Output method in the following format:  
`methodName token1, token2, token3, token4, ...sequence_length`
* To get a better idea about tokenization, see: [BugramVisitor.java](src/main/java/Tokenizer/Visitors/BugramVisitor.java)
* This project does not filter out rare tokens

#### Generating tokens
* `java -cp build/libs/Tokenizer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar Tokenizer.App --dir path/to/java/projects > java-tokens.txt`

### Building the JAR
You can edit the source code and build your own jar
* Install [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* Run `./gradlew build`
* `Tokenizer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` will be created in `build/libs/`
