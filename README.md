# Using Deep Learning to Detect Off-by-One Errors in Java Source Code
This repository contains the data and code to replicate Master's Thesis on models of source code that find off-by-one 
erros in Java source code.

## Quick Start
There are 3 different models:  
* [Code2Seq](code2seq)  
* [Code2Vec](code2vec)  
* [GREAT](great)  
* [Baseline](baseline)  
* [Bugram](bugram)  

You can find documentation on using them in their respective folders.

### Source Code for Demo Webpage
[Offside webpage](offside-webpage) contains files for a demo web-page to illustrate the working of the Code2Seq based 
model. See the folder for additional information.
